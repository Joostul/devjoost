      <description>About me&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;I am a software engineer based in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands.

I love cloud development because of the ability to script everything. Recently my experience has been mostly Azure Kubernetes Service and everything that comes with that. Although at home I have been dabbling in on premises development with my home server, which also lead me to make this page.</description>
