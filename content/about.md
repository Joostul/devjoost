## About me

I am a software engineer based in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands.
Things that I like about software engineering are:

* never stop learning
* collaborating
* [presenting ideas and techniques](https://sessionize.com/joost-van-uitert/)

Most of my experience is with the Azure cloud.
I love cloud development because of the ability to script everything.
Recently my experience has been mostly Azure Kubernetes Service and everything that comes with that.
Although at home I have been dabbling in on premises development with my home server, which also lead me to make this page.

This is my personal blog where I shared things about my passions or whatever I learn along the way.
Sometimes that will be code or small useful snippets.
Sometimes that will be a long post about a passion of mine, mainly:

* (split) keyboards
* 3D printing
* homelabs/homeservers
* dogs (especially my own)
* cloud development
* software development
