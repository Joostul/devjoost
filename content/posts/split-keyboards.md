## Introduction

Keyboards have been around forever and we use them every day for up to 12 hours a day.
We type millions of words per year without even thinking about the how and why of the keyboard.
Maybe the keyboard you use is your standard laptop keyboard, a seperate keyboard, or even a mechanical keyboard with fancy switches and lights.
Today you will learn why they are all bad.

## A normal keyboard?

Your keyboard probably looks very similar to the picture below; it has more than one hundred keys, some of which you never even touched.
It has a qwerty layout, which means that on the start of the top row it spells out 'qwerty'.
It has a huge spacebar that you only use with the same finger every time anyway.
There are three rows of letters, which are staggered vertically, meaning the second row is a quarter of a key the right of the first row and the third row is an extra half of a key to the right of the second row.

## A bit of history

Standard keyboards are an adaptation of a typewriter, which people used to use before computers where a thing.
You would put a piece of paper in your machine and when you pressed a key, a lever would stamp a bit of ink on the paper that correlates to the letter your pressed.
The first commercially successful typewriter is from the year 1873.
As you can see in the image below, it did not have the number '1'.
Instead they used the letter i, which is also (part of) the reason it is so close to the numbers eight and nine.
It was to make typing the year 18xx and later 19xx easier.
We still use this layout today, even though we do not benefit at all from the location of the 'i' key.
The vertical stagger that I discussed before is also visible.
This was done so that the little levers on the keys would not jam together when you pressed two keys that where in close proximity to each other.
We still basically use typewriters even though they are objectively bad to type on for a computer.

## Touch typing

A quick sidenote on how you're supposed to type on a keyboard.
On each keyboard there are two little bumps on the (on a qwerty layout) 'f' and 'j' keys.
Feel them on your own keyboard now.
This is so that you can find these keys without looking with your index fingers.
Then you should type by moving your fingers vertically to reach the top and bottom row.
And by now you also see, or feel, the problem.
The rows are staggered and reaching for the 'y' key with your right index finger is different from reaching the 'r' key with your left index finger.
You might be used to it by now, but it is objectively bad design.

## Alternative staggers

The stagger problem is easily solveable by just making a grid of keys instead of staggering the rows.
Although even better is a 'columnar stagger', seen in the image below.
The reason the columnar stagger is so comfortable is because most people's fingers are not the same length.
Your pinky finger is probably shorter than your middle finger, which is why if you want to reach the same key in the column, the column for the pinky finger should be a bit lower than the column for the middle finger.

## Keyboard layouts

As mentioned the standard layout on most keyboards is qwerty.
But can we be more efficient?
